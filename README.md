# waifu-conversation
talking to the waifu via mic

# how to install in bash (recommended)

copy paste the following in the command line:

sudo apt install awscli mplayer arecord jq

then run the script with ./final.sh

I added aws config in the script so you can enter your information for aws-cli.

Also remember to create an s3 bucket and put the information for the bucket in the script along with the rapidAPI for waifuAI.

# how to install python

1.run pip install -r requirements.txt

2.run main.py

3.hope it works

You'll also need aws poly api, waifu ai rapid api and assemblyai api.
